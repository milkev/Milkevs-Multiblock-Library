### Essentially abandoned. I'll try to keep it updated to the latest version of minecraft, but dont expect any content updates for quite a while. Just got a lot of other things id rather do, yah know?


Behold, my stuff.


Various blocks, items, tools and mechanics that Milkev would consider essential to any* playthrough of minecraft.

~~In the future this should come to have a fair bit more content! I've got lots of plans, though I don't know how to program most of them, so it will be a lot of learning for me.~~

All (future and present) blocks, items, tools and mechanics have configs to individually enable / disable them, as well as change their values

From a private datapack I made a while ago. This makes the following changes;<br>
  -Cobwebs are craftable from string and vice versa just like other material blocks<br>
  -Ancient debris is effected by fortune (drops scrap, use silk touch if you want the debris itself)<br>
  -Wheat is properly effected by fortune (in vanilla only the seeds are)

Fabric only, if anyone wants to port it to forge hmu or make a pull request but I'm not doing it myself.
